= Koble Kernel

== Overview

This project is for compiling a
link:https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.14-rc7/virt/uml/user_mode_linux_howto_v2.html#building-a-uml-instance[User Mode Linux]
kernel for use with link:https://github.com/b177y/koble[Koble].

== Building

To build the kernel run

[source,sh]
----
./pleasew build //:kernel
----

This will output the kernel to `plz-out/bin/linux`.

OR to create a kernel tarball:

[source,sh]
----
./pleasew build //:archive
----

This will create an archive at `plz-out/gen/koble-kernel-VERSION.tar.gz`
containing the `linux` binary.

NOTE: If you already have `plz` installed you can replace `./pleasew` with
it in these commands.

== Usage

The kernel is intended to be used with link:https://github.com/b177y/koble[Koble]
however can be used for testing without Koble.

For example:

[source,sh]
----
./linux name=test umid=test mem=132M ubd0=test-overlay.disk,/path/to/koble-fs root=98:0 con0=fd:0,fd:1 con1=null hosthome=$HOME
----

NOTE: you must have a filesystem built for this, such as link:https://github.com/b177y/koble-fs[koble-fs].
