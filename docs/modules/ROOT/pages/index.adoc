== Usage

The kernel is intended to be used with link:https://github.com/b177y/koble[Koble]
however can be used for testing without Koble.

For example:

[source,sh]
----
./linux name=test umid=test mem=132M ubd0=test-overlay.disk,/path/to/koble-fs root=98:0 con0=fd:0,fd:1 con1=null hosthome=$HOME
----

NOTE: you must have a filesystem built for this, such as link:https://github.com/b177y/koble-fs[koble-fs].
