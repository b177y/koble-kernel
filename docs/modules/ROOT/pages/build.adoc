= Building

== Build Linux Binary

To build the kernel run

NOTE: If you already have `plz` installed you can replace `./pleasew` with
it in these commands.

[source,sh]
----
./pleasew build //:kernel
----

This will output the kernel to `plz-out/bin/linux`.

== Creating Tarball with Binary

[source,sh]
----
./pleasew build //:archive
----

This will create an archive at `plz-out/gen/koble-kernel-VERSION.tar.gz`
containing the `linux` binary.
