= Patches

== Overview

Koble uses a patched Linux kernel to allow additional functionality
and stability.
An example of a kernel patch is the addition of random MAC addresses
for network interfaces in a way that makes collisions unlikely.
This is taken from
link:https://github.com/netkit-jh/netkit-jh-build[Netkit].

== Creating Patches

To create a patch you need two copies of the Linux kernel source.
Use the URL defined by `KERNEL_URL` in *BUILD* to fetch the source code:

[source,sh]
----
wget https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/linux-5.14.9.tar.xz
tar -xvf linux-5.14.9.tar.xz
mv linux-source-5.14.9 linux-orig
cp -r linux-orig linux-custom
----

Now you can make changed to the source code within the `linux-custom`
directory (while leaving `linux-orig` as it is).

To create a patch from the changes run:

[source,sh]
----
diff -urpN linux-orig linux-custom > 93-tutorial-example.patch
----

== Adding Patches to the Kernel Build

You can move the `.patch` file to the `patches/` directory.
The patch must also be added to the file `patches/series`, e.g:

.patches/series
[source]
----
02_x-terminal-emulator.patch
03_uml_switch.patch
05_fix_static_build.patch
08-fix-pcap-linkage.patch
90-netkit_support.patch
93-tutorial-example.patch
